## Sound Board

We have a Mackie 1604-VLZ PRO sound board ([pdf manual](http://www.mackie.com/pdf/1604vlzpro_om.pdf)).
The sound board controls volume to the camera, the stage monitors, the booth monitors, and the main speakers.

The aux lines are connected as follows:

* 1 - stage monitors
* 3 - video camera

I highly recommend that you read through the manual at least once. It's a fun read, even if you are relatively new to audio mixing.

## Rack

The main thing that you need to do with the rack is to turn everything on. Most of the power switches have round purple stickers next to them.

One knob that you may want to adjust is on the bottom amp. One of the channels is the booth monitors. If you want to only monitor with the headphones, turn the speakers down here. If you want to hear the mix over the booth speakers, turn up this amp.
