title: Converting videos
---

Sometimes, you'll receive a video that can't be played on the computer in the sound booth. Chances are it's valid, just in a format that Pro Presenter and/or Mac OS don't understand. You'll be able to tell that the video file is unusable by double-clicking on it. If it opens and plays, then it's OK. If it's named something like "blah.wmv" and doesn't play, then it needs to be converted.

Thankfully, some clever people created an app called [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) and gave it away for free.

## Converting video

1. Click on the üîç in the top-right of the screen and type "Handbrake". Press <key>return</key>.
1. In the dialog box that opens, find the original video (e.g. "napoleon-dynamite.wmv"). Click "Open".
1. Click the green Start button.
1. When it's finished, there will be a new m4v file in the same folder as the original file (e.g. "napoleon-dynamite.m4v").

## Adding the video to the service

1. Open Pro Presenter.
1. Click the "File" menu, then "Import" ‚ñ∫ "Import Video/Image...".
1. Find the video file. Click "Open".
1. Drag the video from the Video/Image Bin to the Playlist.
1. Try playing it to ensure that it's working.
