We're currently running a trial of ProPresenter, using a Mac laptop. This page documents how to switch the sound booth computer from the GoFish PC to the Mac laptop.

### Switching from PC to Mac

1. Open the laptop.
1. Connect the blue monitor cable to the blue adapter, and plug into the blue port on the laptop.
1. Connect the white monitor cable to the white adapter, and plug into the white port on the laptop.
1. Plug in the laptop's power cord.
1. Turn on the laptop by pressing the power button (![](/images/onoff.png)) in the top-right corner of the keyboard.
1. Click on "CCC", password is "ccc".

The monitor on the wall should have a picture of the sky on it. You can get to it by moving the mouse off the left edge of the laptop’s screen.

The projector / monitor on the right should have a picture of fields. You can get to it by moving the mouse off the right edge of the laptop’s screen.

If you’ve switched the monitor cables, the displays will be switched.

### Switching from Mac to PC

1. Turn off the laptop: In the apple menu in the top left corner of the screen, pick "Shut down".
1. Unplug the cables from the laptop.
1. Connect the blue cable to the USB display adapter on the gofish computer.
1. Connect the white cable to the built-in display port. It’s right above another monitor cable.
