Every week, two volunteers are responsible for working with the worship team to prepare for the weekly worship service, and then to provide projection and audio for the congregation.

### Computer / Projection

For the computer, there are three main jobs to do each week.

1. Set up the the songs that the worship team chose.
2. Make any necessary adjustments at practice.
3. Run through the slides during the worship service.

More detailed tasks are listed below.

#### Tasks

* [Turn things on](general/turn-on-or-off/)
* [Set up songs in ProPresenter](computer/set-up-the-program/)
    - [Change background images](computer/change-background-image) (todo)
    - [Fix misspelled words](computer/fix-typo/) (todo)
    - [Change awkward breaks between slides](computer/change-slide-break/) (todo)
* [Import the sermon](computer/set-up-sermon/) (todo)
* [Turn things off](general/turn-on-or-off/)

During worship service, you just have to go through the slides. In a way, you're leading the worship team and congregation, so try to change the slide early enough that the singers can keep up with the music.

### Audio

On the sound board, there are two main jobs each week.

1. Initial setup at the worship team practice.
2. Run the audio board and camera during the worship service.

More detailed tasks are listed below. Some of these are shared with the Computer task list above.
