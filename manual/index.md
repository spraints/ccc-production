Every week, two volunteers are responsible for working with the worship team to prepare for the weekly worship service, and then to provide projection and audio for the congregation.

### Computer / Projection

For the computer, there are three jobs to do each week. The first is to set up the program with the songs that the worship team chose. The second is to make final adjustments at the worship team practice. The third is to run through the program in the worship service.

#### During the week

The worship team usually chooses songs for a month at a time. They're usually ready mid-week on the first week that the songs are for. Sometime prior to the worship team practice, someone (usually Matt or Skip) will [set up the program](computer/set-up-the-program/).

#### Worship team practice

At worship team practice, you should run through the songs as if it were the worship service, and watch for these things:

* [misspelled words](computer/fix-typo/)
* [awkward breaks between slides](computer/change-slide-break/)

Additionally, feel free to change any of these things:

* [background image for a song](computer/change-background-image)
* [image for communion](computer/change-background-image)

#### Worship service

On Sunday, before service:

* [turn on the projector and stage display TV](house/turn-on-displays/)
* [set up the sermon slides](computer/set-up-sermon)

During worship service, you just have to go through the slides. In a way, you're leading the worship team and congregation, so try to change the slide early enough that the singers can keep up with the music.

### Audio

On the sound board, there are two jobs each week. The first is to do initial setup at the worship team practice. The second is to run the audio board and camera during the worship service.

#### Worship team practice

At worship team practice:

* [turn on lights](house/turn-on-lights/)
* [tune the board](audio/tune-the-board/)
* [change microphone batteries](audio/change-batteries/)
* [turn off lights](house/turn-off-lights/)

#### Worship service

At practice on Sunday morning:

* [turn on lights](house/turn-on-lights/)
* [tune the board](audio/tune-the-board/)
* [check the camera's audio level](video/check-camera-audio/)
* [set up the nursery feed](video/set-up-nursery/)

During service:

* [record video on camera](video/record-with-camera/) (This is the view that people who are watching online will have. Zoom in as much as possible, without losing the person or people who you're recording.)
* [record audio on the board](audio/record-with-board/)
* adjust the board as necessary
