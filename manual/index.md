Every week, two volunteers are responsible for working with the worship team to prepare for the weekly worship service, and then to provide projection and audio for the congregation.

### Computer / Projection

For the computer, there are three jobs to do each week. The first is to set up the program with the songs that the worship team chose. The second is to make final adjustments at the worship team practice. The third is to run through the program in the worship service.

#### Set up the program

The worship team usually chooses songs for a month at a time. They're usually ready mid-week on the first week that the songs are for. To set up a program for a worship service, do this:

1. Open ProPresenter
2. In the playlist panel (bottom left), add an entry for the date of the service.
3. Add the following stock items from the library:
  * **Announcements - week N** (where N is the week of the month)
  * **Welcome**
  * **Communition**
  * **Offering**
  * **Closing Announcements**
4. Change the birthday slides.
5. Add each song from the library to the program, choose the "Normal" arrangment, and apply the "CCC" template.

This setup is usually done by Matt or Skip.

#### Worship team practice

At worship team practice, you should run through the songs as if it were the worship service, and watch for these things:

* misspelled words
* awkward breaks between slides

Additionally, feel free to change any of these things:

* background image for a song
* image for communion

#### Worship service

On Sunday, before service:

* turn on the projector and stage display TV
* set up the sermon slides

During worship service, you just have to go through the slides. In a way, you're leading the worship team and congregation, so try to change the slide early enough that the singers can keep up with the music.

### Audio

On the sound board, there are two jobs each week. The first is to do initial setup at the worship team practice. The second is to run the audio board and camera during the worship service.

#### Worship team practice

At worship team practice:

* turn on lights.
* tune the board.
* change microphone batteries.
* turn off stage lights.

#### Worship service

At practice on Sunday morning:

* turn on lights.
* tune the board.
* check the camera's audio level.
* set up the nursery feed.

During service:

* start recording on the camera. This is the view that people who are watching online will have. Zoom in as much as possible, without losing the person or people who you're recording.
* start recording on the board.
* adjust the board as necessary.
