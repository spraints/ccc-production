This is a fixed set of tasks that need to be done every week, so it's arranged as a checklist.

## Turning on

### In the sound booth

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn on stage lights.** The switches are on the wall to the left of the desk in the sound booth. Turn on all of the toggle switches. Turn on all of the buttons that have a light on them.

(todo - add a picture of all of the switches with highlights around the ones to turn on)

<input type="checkbox"> (Sunday only) **Lower the screen**, if it's not already lowered. The control switch is just to the right and up from the light switches. You'll need to stop lowering the screen just before it touches the decorations on the back wall.

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn on the computer.** Normally, it's left on and you can just wiggle the mouse or press a key on the keyboard. If it doesn't respond, press the power button, which is located on the back bottom left corner of the monitor.

(todo - add a picture of the computer with an arrow pointing to where the power button is, and a pic of the power button)

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn on the auxiliary monitors.** One is mounted on the wall. The other is to the right of the computer.

<input type="checkbox"> (Sunday only) **Turn on the video switcher.** Make sure that the computer is selected.

(todo - add a picture of the switcher with the right lights turned on)

<input type="checkbox"> (Sunday only) **Turn on the nursery camera.** You'll need to turn the dial from "Off" to camera and open the preview panel. If there is no video, open the shutter.

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn on the sound board.** The switch is on the back left side, near the power cord.

(todo - add a picture or two showing this)

<input type="checkbox"> After the sound board is turned on, **turn on the microphone receivers** on the ledge behind the board.

(todo - picture of microphones with power buttons highlighted)

<input type="checkbox"> *After the sound board is turned on, **turn on the equipment in the rack**. Start at the top and work down. The switches you'll turn on are: power strip (microphones), power strip (speakers), amplifier (house), amplifier (subwoofers), amplifier (booth speakers).

### Downstairs

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn on audio stage monitor.** There are two black speakers on the floor. They have toggle switches on the back. A blue light will turn on.

(todo - picture of floor monitors)

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn on video stage monitor.** This is a TV hanging from the back wall. The remote is in the closet behind the stage.

<input type="checkbox"> (Sunday only) **Turn on projector.** The remote is also in the closet behind the stage. It's best to do this _after_ turning on the computer and video switcher. If not, it may eventually become idle because it can't find an active input.

There's a lot of other equipment on the stage. The worship team manages it.

## Turning off

This is mostly the reverse of the turn on steps. The one addition is that you'll need to ensure that microphones are all put away.

### Downstairs

<input type="checkbox"> **Put away all wireless microphones.** There are four handheld microphones and two headsets with body packs.

(todo - add a picture of the microphones in the cabinet)

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off projector.**

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off video stage monitor.**

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off audio stage monitor.** Ideally, you should turn this off before turning off the audio board.

### In the sound booth

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off the equipment in the rack.** Go bottom to top, so that the power strips are turned off last.

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off the microphone receivers on the ledge.**

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off the sound board.** Before doing this, make sure that recording is stopped and the USB light is off. 1. Touch the gray "Home" button next to the touchscreen. 2. Touch "Shutdown" on the touchscreen. 3. Turn off the power button on the back of the board.

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off the nursery camera.**

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off the recording camera.**

<input type="checkbox"> **Turn off the video switcher.**

<input type="checkbox"> **Log out of the computer.** 1. Click the Apple logo in the top left. 2. "Log Out CCC..."
