# Troubleshooting

## Audio

### Feedback
* Find the channel where it's coming from. Usually it'll make the red light turn on. Turn down the preamp for that channel.
* Sometimes feedback happens because the speakers are putting out too much sound. If this is the case, try turning down the main fader for LR or the floor monitors.

### Crackling or no sound
* Trace the circuit and ensure all cables are plugged in.
* If there's still no sound or crackling, try unplugging and plugging them in again to ensure they're seated well.
* If there's still no sound or crackling, try unscrewing the cable ends and inspecting the soldering. Start with cables that get moved. This usually means checking the ones on stage.
* If there's still no sound, try checking the board. Select the channel, press the "Routing" button, then touch the screen's "Mix Sends" tab. Ensure the channel is on for LR, etc.

## Video

### No picture?
* Open the camera shutter.

## Computer

## Booth

### UPS is making a loud squeal
* Ensure it's plugged in. If it's unplugged, it will make an alarm when the battery's charge gets low.
* If it's plugged in, the battery may be at the end of its life. Unplug the UPS, purchase a new battery, and install it. I recommend using OEM (e.g. APC) batteries. Dispose of the old battery properly.
