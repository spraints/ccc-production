To set up a program for a worship service, do this:

1. Open ProPresenter
2. In the playlist panel (bottom left), add an entry for the date of the service.
3. Add the following stock items from the library:
  * **Announcements - week N** (where N is the week of the month)
  * **Welcome**
  * **Communition**
  * **Offering**
  * **Closing Announcements**
4. Change the birthday slides.
5. Add each song from the library to the program, choose the "Normal" arrangment, and apply the "CCC" template.

This setup is usually done by Matt or Skip.
