Tuning the board is the first step to getting a good mix. Start by setting the pre-amp gain for each channel, then get a good blend, and finally make sure it sounds good in the house.

Here is what a fader strip looks like:

Here is what the shared processing controls look like:

### Setting gain

For each input, while the instrument is playing or the singer is singing:

1. If we're not using it, mute it, and skip the rest.
2. Press the "Sel" button on the fader strip.
3. Adjust the "Preamp" gain until the signal peaks slightly above 0 (yellow). It shouldn't stay in the yellow, and it definitely shouldn't hit red.

### Setting names

For the singers, you can assign a name to the channel.

1. Press the PAFL button on the fader strip.
2. Put on the headphones and listen for whose voice you're hearing.
3. Press the "Processing" button (to the right of the touchscreen).
4. On the touchscreen, touch the pencil and enter the name.


### Check the blend

1. Press the PAFL button that's in the mix strip (this is where the LR and mix buttons are).
2. Press the Grp1-2 button. In the headphones, you'll be able to hear the singers. Adjust the faders until there's a good mix.
3. Press the Grp3-4 button. Now you can hear the instruments and can balance them against each other.
4. Press the LR button. Now you can balance the entire mix.

### Check the house

During practice, press the LR button and pull its fader all the way to -Inf. You'll still be able to hear the band, because the monitors at the front of house are pretty loud. The monitors have a mix that's driven by the band, so the relative volumes might not be what sounds good to the congregation. Raise the level of the LR fader until you can hear it kick in. You should be able to hear it around -5dB. I usually try to keep the main mix at about -3dB to 0dB on the meter, which is usually about -5dB on the fader.

At least once during practice and once during the service, walk downstairs and check that the mix sounds OK. I like to listen from the middle of either the left or right side.
